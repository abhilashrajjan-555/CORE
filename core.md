The goal of the project is to create a frictionless, centralized, and automated system for managing all professional (or personal) information.1. Foundational ConceptsThe entire system is built on managing four key types of information. Your AI project needs a strategy for handling each:Information TypeDescriptionAI System GoalTasksAction items and to-dos assigned to you.Must be captured immediately and prioritized.IdeasInformation that originates internally (thoughts, concepts, future plans).Must have a dedicated, easy-access capture location.NotesInformation from external sources (meeting notes, research, web snippets).Must be captured and linked to relevant tasks or media.MediaFiles, folders, and documents (digital assets).Must be filed automatically into a structured system.2. The C.O.R.E. Workflow (The System Blueprint)The AI should be designed to support and automate these four stages:A. CAPTURE (AI-Assisted Entry Points)This stage is about systematically capturing everything from any source to a centralized location.Prompt Idea: "Design a method for 'Capture' where any input (email, voice note, text message) is immediately converted into a structured task, idea, or note."Key Components:Universal Inbox: A single, centralized location (or method) to dump all inputs (tasks, ideas, external notes) immediately.Automated Processing: An automation script that quickly processes the incoming raw captures, tagging them as Task, Idea, or Note, and identifying the next step or project area.Task/Idea Separation: A clear, low-friction mechanism for logging brief ideas (to prevent losing them) versus logging detailed action items.B. ORGANIZE (The File and Knowledge Structure)This stage focuses on creating a file management structure that is simple and reliable (often referencing principles like Tiago Forte's PARA).Prompt Idea: "Develop a file and knowledge structure that uses an Area/Project/Resource hierarchy. Create an automation to rename and file incoming documents based on keywords and existing folders."Key Components:Hierarchical Structure: A simple digital filing system (e.g., in Google Drive, or your chosen database) that moves beyond simple folders. An effective structure often involves:Areas (Long-term focus/Responsibility: e.g., "Marketing," "Finance," "Personal Wellness").Projects (Specific, short-term goals: e.g., "Launch Q3 Campaign," "Build AI Project").Resources (Archived information/References: e.g., "Articles," "Templates").Automated Filing: A script/AI function that can analyze new files/documents and automatically place them into the correct Project or Area folder based on content analysis or file naming conventions.Search Over Sort: The structure must enable finding files "within seconds, not minutes," leveraging powerful search capabilities (AI-powered search is ideal here).C. REVIEW (The AI Rituals)This is the "bulletproof review method" to clear mental clutter and ensure nothing is missed.Prompt Idea: "Define and automate a 'Review Ritual' that provides a comprehensive weekly summary of all incomplete tasks, uncategorized ideas, and new files, formatted for quick processing."Key Components:Daily Review: A quick, 5-minute automated prompt that surfaces:Top 3 most urgent tasks.The schedule for the day.Any "quick-win" tasks (under 5 minutes).Weekly Review: A structured, in-depth report that surfaces:All uncategorized items from the Capture phase.Project progress updates and pending next actions.A clear list for planning the upcoming week, ensuring deadlines are not missed.Routine Management: An automated system that tracks whether the daily and weekly rituals were completed, promoting consistency.D. ENGAGE (Application and Execution)This stage is about making it easy to do the work.Prompt Idea: "Create 'Frictionless Execution' templates/shortcuts that allow me to start a new project or capture a meeting note with a single command, ensuring all relevant filing/tagging is done automatically."Key Components:Templates: Pre-built templates for common work items (Meeting Notes, Project Plans, Brainstorming Sessions) that are automatically saved and linked to the correct Organize folder structure.AI-Generated Prompts: A database of context-aware prompts (mentioned in the course) that can be instantly applied to a captured idea or note to generate a draft or next step.Minimal Effort: The entire system must minimize the clicks, drags, and decisions needed to move from Capture to Organize to Review.
